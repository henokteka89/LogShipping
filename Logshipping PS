Log Shipping Involves - Taking log backup from primary (to a shared storage) Then copy that log backup file to a secondary server (local storage) Finally restored the copied log to the database in secondary. 

Can be done with taking (initializing) a full back in the same process or can be applied after restoring the full backup to a secondary instance with NORecovery or standby (No Initialization). Check which recovery mode is preffered. 


When NoInitialization is needed:
First, restored the full backup of a database in secondary with NORECOVERY. 
Then Initiate the Logshipping (the below DBAtool PS helps do that)
(Make sure there is a shared file storage that can be accessed by both instances)
